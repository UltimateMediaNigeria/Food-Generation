			"Okpa beans is known as Bambara groundnut or simply Bambara nut. In some parts of the world, it is known as Jugo Beans. There are different species of Okpa. It comes in small pods which you crack open to release the seeds. The seeds are very hard and only special heavy duty industrial grinders can easily grind these seeds into powder. So, this one is not a job for your kitchen dry mill",
			"If you live outside Nigeria, you can buy Okpa flour on Amazon. You can also ask family or friends to send you Okpa flour from Nigeria. The customs of most countries will allow it because it is dry powder",
			"You need enough oil to give the okpa a popping yellow colour and to improve the taste",
			"Okpa does not need much seasoning so the ingredients listed above are all you need. Onions and crayfish ruin the natural delicious flavour of okpa",
			"The Okpa mix may seem watery but 1.2 litres of water is the quantity of water you need for the perfect Okpa texture. If you add much less water, you will end up with rocky Okpa",
			"Before you cook Okpa",
			"Prepare the banana leaves by washing them in plenty of salt water. If you have a banana/plantain tree in your backyard, you need to wilt the leaves by passing them over a low flame, then leave them to dry up before using them. You cannot wrap Okpa with fresh banana leaves",
			"Crush the stock/bouillon cubes",
			"Slice the habanero pepper into small pieces",
			"Prepare 1.2 litres of lukewarm water"

Mix the palm oil and flour very well till the palm oil is well incorporated into the flour. You will have a nice even yellow colour when done\n.Pour a generous quantity of water in a big pot and set on the stove to boil\n.Start adding the lukewarm water to the Okpa flour and mix till there are no lumps. Watch the video below to see how I crush the lumps without stress by passing the mix through a sieve with a wire mesh. You can also use a blender to get the smoothest mix. But that's a lot of washing up to do later\n.Add the sliced habanero pepper. Check for salt and add more if necessary and it's ready to be scooped into the wrappers\n.Now the water in the pot should be boiling. If not, wait for it to boil and add some spare wrappers or plastic bags before moving on to the next step. These wrappers and plastic bags act as a base for the Okpa wraps\n.Now to a major step: wrapping the Okpa! In the video and images below, I showed 3 ways to wrap Okpa: 2 with the banana leaves and 1 with plastic bags. Hopefully the images and explanations make sense but if you really want to master wrapping the Okpa, watching the video is so worth it. Go to a cyber cafe if you can't watch it on your phone/gadget. Some things just can't be adequately explained in writing\n.After tying one end of the banana leaves as shown in the video and image links below, stir the okpa mix very well and scoop into the leaf/plastic bag. Tie the other end with a string and place the wrapped okpa in the pot of boiling water. It is important that the Okpa is completely immersed in the hot water\n.Repeat the above step for the rest of the mix. Make sure you stir the mix, scoop into the wrapper, tie with the string and put in the pot of boiling water before wrapping another one\n.When done, cover the wraps with more leaves or plastic bags. Cover the pot and start cooking medium to high heat\n.Cook for at least 1 hour before checking it. The Okpa is done when it is solid all over\n.Wrapping Okpa\n.How to wrap Okpa with banana leaves (Method common in Enugu State, Nigeria)\n.Place 2 sheets of banana leaves on a flat surface\n.Fold one end to meet the other (vertically)\n.Roll up the open end like a mat till you have enough fold to prevent a leakage\n.Gather one end together and tie it up securely with the string\n.Stir and pour the mix into the bag\n.Tie up the other end and it is ready to go into the pot of boiling water\n.How to wrap Okpa with banana leaves (method common in Anambra State, Nigeria)\n.Place 2 sheets of banana leaves on a flat surface\n.Fold it into 2 (horizontally)\n.Roll up one the open end like a mat till you have enough fold to prevent a leakage\n.Pick it up and place the pointed end in the cup of your palm\n.Stir and pour the mix into the bag\n.Fold the other end like a mat and gather the only open end together and tie it up securely with the string\n.And it is ready to go into the pot of boiling water\n.How to wrap Okpa with plastic bags (if you do not have banana leaves)\n.You can simply scoop the okpa mix into plastic bags, tie it up and place in the pot of boiling water but this is how to get the classic Okpa shape when using plastic bags\n.Double the plastic bags and tie the end with a string\n.Stir and scoop the mix into the bag\n.Tie it about half way up the bag\n.Stir and scoop the mix into the second half of the bag\n.Tie again and it is ready to go into the pot of boiling water\n.For breakfast, serve with cocoa drink (Milo, Ovaltine drink), Akamu or Ogi, custard meal or oatmeal. For lunch or dinner, serve with soaked Garri (asoki). You can also eat it as a snack with a chilled drink.\n"

I usually break one strand of spaghetti into three pieces\n.3 Cut the beef into small pieces\n.It is best to buy the part of beef that has streaks of fat in it\n.This greatly improves the taste of this meal\n.4 Wash and cut the cabbage, green pepper and green beans into small pieces. Also wash, scrape and cut the carrots into tiny pieces. Cut the onions into small pieces and remove the green peas from the pods. If you will use tinned green peas, simply drain the preservation water and rinse with some fresh water\n.Directions 1. Cook the beef with the onions, thyme and stock cubes. 2. While the meat is cooking, start cooking the spaghetti in a generous amount of water in a separate pot. 3. When the beef is done, add the tomato stew. Add the vegetables, salt and pepper to taste and cook for about 5 minutes. Set aside\n. 4 When the spaghetti is done to your personal preference, decant the water and pour the mixture of beef stock and tomato stew you prepared earlier into the pot of spaghetti. 5. Stir well, turn off the heat, cover and leave to stand for about 5 minutes before serving. Spaghetti Surprise is perfect when eaten on its own but can be served with Fried Plantains. Tips for Cooking Spaghetti 1. Spaghetti should be cooked with a big pot. That is, the pot should contain the spaghetti and still have plenty of unused volume. 2. Spaghetti should also be cooked in plenty of water. The quantity of water should be at least double the level of the spaghetti. 3. To cook spaghetti, first of all, boil water; add a few spoons of vegetable oil to the boiling water and add the spaghetti. Stir the contents very well and cover the pot. With some spaghetti, you need to stir till the water starts to boil again before covering the pot. The large amount of water, the boiling water and the vegetable oil altogether prevent the spaghetti strands from sticking together while cooking.\n"

The flavour of the rooster is preserved because it is roasted, not cooked with water. Even though hen is tastier, it will take much longer to get done if you use it for this recipe. Seasoning for the body of the chicken I only add ground ehu seeds when I want to give the chicken a sort of barbecue/pepper soup flavour. Feel free to use other seasonings you like. Stuffing You can experiment with other herbs, seasonings and vegetables. It is not advisable to use soft vegetables because they will be overcooked by the time the chicken is done. Side dish You can skip the potatoes and use only rice. Just parboil the quantity of rice that will be enough for the stuffing and side dish. Cover the rice with aluminium foil so that it will not be dry when done. Before you roast the chicken • Prepare the blend of seasonings for the body of the chicken by mixing the dry ground pepper, stock cube (crushed) and ground ehu seeds. • Scrape and cut the carrots into small cubes and cut the onion into small pieces. • Peel and cut the potatoes into wedges. You can leave the skin on if you want (not normally practiced in Nigeria though)."

		"instructions": "1 Prepare the stuffing. a Parboil the rice like you would parboil rice for Nigerian Jollof Rice. Rinse and put in a sieve to drain. If you will be using only rice as your side dish, you will need to parboil enough rice for this purpose. b. Put the rice in a bowl, add the curry powder and mix well. c. Add the diced carrots, green peas, diced onions, thyme, salt and some vegetable oil. Stir well and set aside\n.2 Stuff the Chicken a. Rinse the chicken and dry with a paper towel. b. Stuff the inside with the seasoned rice and vegetables. Do not over fill it because remember that this rice is only parboiled and it will rise as it cooks. c. When done, tie the legs of the chicken. This helps the chicken maintain a more presentable shape when done. You don't want it sagging and all over the place. d. Set your oven to 180°C (350°F) to preheat. e. Rub some vegetable oil on the chicken, sprinkle the blend of seasonings we prepared earlier and rub it all over the body of the chicken. f. Make sure the chicken's wings are tucked away under the chicken or into the string you used to tie up the chicken\n.3 Prepare the side dish a. If you want to use only rice as your side dish, then you should have prepared enough in step 1. b. If using potatoes, place the wedges in a bowl, add the remaining seasoning from the one you rubbed on the body of the chicken, add thyme, salt and some vegetable oil. c. Toss to evenly distribute the seasoning and set aside\n.4 Arrange, then roast a. Dish the remaining rice from the stuffing into an oven tray leaving some space at the centre for the chicken. b. Place the chicken at the centre. c. Add the seasoned potatoes around the chicken and place in the preheated oven and bake for one and a half hours. d. The chicken is done when it is golden, the rice inside the chicken is well done and a cut into the chicken thigh shows a white flesh with some succulent juice. If it is pinkish or even red when you cut it, the chicken is not done. Serve portions of the chicken with the rice and roasted potatoes.\n"

Unless you like some bitterness in your Bitterleaf Soup, make sure that the bitter leaves are well washed, such that there is no trace of bitterness left. If not, wash and squeeze it more. If the bitterness cannot be completely washed off (which is usually the case with most washed bitter leaves sold in the market), boil it for 5 minutes and rinse with cold water.

		],
		"instructions": "Directions The Meat Pie Filling 1. Peel the potato and scrape the carrot, wash and cut these two into tiny cubes\n.2 Wash and cut the onions into tiny pieces\n.3 Using a pot, heat the vegetable oil (medium heat), add the diced onions and stir for a bit, add the minced meat and stir vigorously till the meat turns pale\n.4 Add the stock cube and thyme. Pour water to the same level as the minced beef. Cover the pot and once the contents of the pot start boiling; add the diced carrots and potatoes\n.5 When the ingredients are well done, dissolve 1 tablespoon of plain flour in ¼ cup of cold water and add to the meat pie filling. This keeps the filling moist and prevents it from drying up during baking\n.6 Add salt to taste, stir the contents and turn off the heat. Set the filling aside to cool down completely\n.  Te Meat Pie dough 1. Sift the flour into a sizeable bowl; add the baking powder and salt. You do not need a lot of salt for the dough because the meat pie gets most of its taste from the filling. Mix these dry ingredients very well\n. 2 Use a tablespoon to scoop the margarine in small bits into the bowl of flour. The smaller you make the bits of margarine, the easier it will be for you to rub them into the flour\n. 3 Use finger tips to rub the margarine into the flour till the mix becomes like crumbs\n.4 Add cold water in bits and mix by hand till a stiff ball of dough is formed. At most, all you need for the 1 kg of flour is half a cup of water\n.5 Place the dough on a flat surface and knead till smooth\n.6 Put back in the bowl, cover and leave it to rest for about 10 minutes. This gives the dough a softer texture and makes it easier to work with. Cut, Fill, Fold and Close 1. Break the egg, beat it and set aside; you will use it for glazing. 2. Rub margarine on the insides of the oven tray and set aside. This is so that the undersides of the meat pies do not burn or stick to the tray during baking. 3. Set your oven to 170°C (335°F) and leave to preheat while you continue  with the meat pie. For fan ovens, set to 150°C (300°F) and gas mark 3 or 4 for gas ovens. 4. Knead the dough again. Roll out the dough with a rolling pin to a 5mm thickness. If well mixed, the dough should not stick to the surface. 5. Use a cutter, be it the cover of a small pot or a meat pie cutter, to make round cuts on the rolled out dough. 6. Remove the excess dough, leaving behind the round cuts. 7. Scoop some filling into the centre of the round cuts, the quantity should be such that you can comfortably close the dough without overflows. 8. Rub the egg on the inside edge of the cut meat pie dough. This ensures that the meat pie is perfectly sealed and does not open up while it is being baked.  9. Fold one part of the dough to meet the other end. 10. Use a fork to press the 2 edges together to close the pie making sure that the top and bottom dough are combined. This is so that the pie does not open during baking. 11. Place this in the greased oven tray and repeat steps 4-10 for the rest of the dough. Rub the egg on the meat pies using a brush. This gives the pies a golden brown look when done. 12. Set the tray in the preheated oven and bake for 40 to 50 minutes or till  light brown. This time will depend on the type and heating capacity of your oven. Whatever type of oven you have, the important thing to note is that the best meat pies are the ones baked at medium heat. You can confirm that the meat pie is done when it starts browning. It is alright to open the oven to check this.\n"

		],
		"instructions": "The quantities of ingredients listed above are what I used for a cake baked with a 10 inch diameter, 2.5 inch deep cake pan\n.When done, the cake had a diameter of 10 inches (of course) and a height of 2.5 inches with a slight done\n.Tools • An oven with top & down heating capability. • Cake mixer • Kitchen scale • Sieve or Sifter • Egg whisk • Bowls • Spatulas • Cake pan More information on the ingredients Butter: Use baking butter NOT margarine. You can buy baking butter from any shop that sells bakery ingredients. Some people told me that they successfully made this cake with margarine but the original recipe for Nigerian cakes calls for butter\n.Do not melt the butter. Bring it out from the fridge a day before making the cake. This way, it will be soft enough for creaming on the day you'll bake the cake. Sugar: If too coarse, grind the granulated sugar with a dry mill (the one used for grinding egusi, ogbono, etc) before adding it to the butter for creaming. You only need to grind it a little bit to reduce the size of the grains of sugar. This reduces the creaming time. Do not use icing (powdered) sugar. Flavour: The vanilla extract adds a vanilla flavour to the cake\n.Other flavours can be used eg butterscotch (used in wedding cakes). Dry Fruits: Dry fruits such as raisins can be added to this cake. Soak these in brandy for at least 1 week (up to 1 month for wedding cakes) before adding it to the cake. This is so that the fruits will not make the cake go bad or taste funny after some time especially for wedding cakes. Brandy: The brandy is a preservative for the cake. With all those eggs in the cake, it can go bad before the event if you don't add brandy to it. This is especially the case if you’ll put the cake out on a table for about a week while decorating it. But for cakes you’ll put in the freezer immediately, brandy is not necessary. Any cake preservative can make a great alternative to brandy. Before you start • Make sure that all the utensils and appliances you will use for the cake are clean and dry. • Check, check and check that you have all the ingredients you will need to bake the cake. Directions 1. Put the soft butter and the granulated sugar into the mixer bowl and cream till the mix is as white and soft as possible. A well-creamed butter and sugar mix has the following properties: a. Is much whiter than the butter you started with. b. Is very soft and creamy, can drop from a spoon. c. The sugar can hardly be felt when tasted. 2. When the creaming is almost done, rub the insides of the baking pan with soft butter. Spread some flour inside the greased pan, making sure that the flour touches all parts of the pan, then pour out the flour. 3. Break all the eggs into a big bowl and whisk till they are smooth. 4. When the creaming is complete, add the eggs into the creamed butter and mix till well incorporated. 5. Add the vanilla extract or any other flavour of your choice. Mix well with a spatula. Also add the pre-soaked dry fruits and brandy at this time. 6. Turn on the oven to 150°C or 300°F to preheat while you finish mixing the cake. Switch it to the top & down heating setting. 7. Add the baking powder to the flour and mix well. Pass these through a sifter or sieve and add to the bowl of cake mix. Add a little at a time and stir in one direction with the spatula. Stirring in one direction is necessary so that air bubbles will not be trapped in the cake mix and create holes in the cake when done. 8. When everything is well incorporated, pour the mix into the cake pan. Lift and gently drop the pan several times to level out the mix. To make a patterned coloured cake (marble cake), divide the cake mix into the number of colours. Add the colours to each portion, mix till the colour is well incorporated then pour into the cake pan one after the other to create levels of colours. 9. Place the cake pan in the preheated oven and bake till the cake has risen to maximum before attempting to open the oven door. If using the same quantity of ingredients stated for this recipe, this should take about 2 hours. Check the Cake When the cake is no longer rising, the following are how to check it to make sure it is done. a. Drive a knife into the centre of the cake. If the knife comes out with smears of the cake mix, then the cake is not done. If it comes out clean and dry, with only a smear of butter (oily look) then the cake is done. If the cake passes the knife test, I go on to do the other tests\n.b. Take a look at the sides of the cake pan. The cake should be separated from the pan or at least not stuck to the pan\n.c. Dip a wooden skewer (stick) into the middle of the cake. Wooden skewers are rougher than knives so they pick up smears more\n.If the wooden skewer comes out clean, the cake is done. d. Gently push the cake down at the middle with an open palm\n.If the cake springs back when you lift your palm and there is no palm impression on the cake, then the cake is done\n.Cool and Decorate/Freeze Once you are sure that the cake is done, bring it out of the oven and leave it alone for only 5 minutes and take out the sides of the pan\n.Leave to cool down completely before decorating the cake. Or cut it up and store in the freezer.\n"

It is not advisable to use a deep fryer for Puff Puff because of the netting which scatters the puff puff\n.6 Test that the oil is hot enough by putting a drop of batter into the oil. If it sizzles and comes up to the surface of the oil, then the oil is hot enough. If the oil is not hot enough, the batter will go down to the bottom of the oil and stay there\n.7 When the oil is hot enough, scoop some batter into the oil with your hand by squeezing out the batter from between your thumb and index finger. This technique is what makes the Puff Puff have the perfect spherical shape\n. 8 Squeeze in as much batter as the space in the frying pot will allow without overcrowding\n. 9 Once the underside has turned golden brown, flip the ball so that the topside will be fried as well. Sometimes it is impossible to control the balls as they keep flipping by themselves; this means you got the mixture right. In that case, just keep stirring till the puff puff is brown all over. 10. When golden brown, take out the balls and place in a paper lined sieve. Note: Puff Puff is an oily snack, nothing much can be done about the oil in it. If you want a similar but less oily snack, you should try Nigerian Buns. Tip: You can use pizza flour to make Puff Puff. When you use it, there will be no need to add yeast because pizza flour already contains yeast. In fact, it contains so much yeast that if you use it as is; the Puff Puff will have an after taste of yeast. I usually mix 2 parts of pizza flour with 1 part of plain flour to tone down the yeast.\n"

Fry the buns at medium heat, stirring constantly, till light brown/deep yellow. I usually fry mine for 25 minutes. Notes: When you first add the buns to the oil, they go to the bottom of the pot and slowly come up to the surface as they cook. It is important to keep stirring (without denting the balls) till they come up to the surface. Nigerian Buns are the less oily siblings to the Nigerian Puff Puff. They are very dense inside unlike Puff Puff which is spongy.\n"

It is quite soft to the bite. I encourage you to try both to see the one you prefer\n. 3 Nutmeg is essential for the authentic taste of Chin Chin\n.4 You can spray some loose flour on the chin chin after cutting them to stop them from sticking together but do not use too much loose flour as it causes the oil to foam during frying. Sometimes it may foam so much that the chin chin becomes soggy and will not dry up\n.Directions 1. Sift the flour into a bowl, add sugar and nutmeg. Mix thoroughly. \n.Note: If using powdered milk, add it at this time\n.2 Use a tablespoon to scoop the margarine in small bits into the bowl of flour.

After some time, spread out on a flat tray to dry and cool down quickly\n.When the chin chin has cooled down completely, store them in a dry, airtight container. Notes: 1. The oil for frying Chin Chin must be very hot, if not, the Chin Chin will think it is being cooked hence become soggy and will never dry up. Low oil temperature causes foaming too. 2. Fry in a generous amount of oil and do not overcrowd the Chin Chin as this causes foaming too. Again, soggy Chin Chin. 3. While frying, once you notice the sogginess, change the oil. 4. Use loose flour sparingly while cutting them because it causes foaming. If you mix the Chin Chin with the exact quantities of ingredients stated for this recipe, the pieces will not stick together while you are cutting them and there will be no need for loose flour. Even if they stick together, once they hit the hot oil and you stir constantly, they will come apart.\n"

I got 6 sausage rolls with the stated quantities of ingredients\n.2. Satis® is a popular brand of sausage in Nigeria. Directions The Filling You can either use the sausages as they come in the pack or you can season them before using them in the sausage roll. To season them: a. Cut the sausage into small cubes. b. Add the ground nutmeg. c. Crush the stock cubes with your fingers and add to the mashed sausages. At this time, feel free to add any other seasoning that catches your fancy. d. Stir well to mix the added ingredients with the mashed sausages. e. Use a hand blender to blend the sausages into a smooth paste. Mix with a spoon to make sure the seasonings are well incorporated\n.Set aside. The dough The dough is mixed the same way as that of Nigerian Meat Pie. a. Sift the flour into a sizeable bowl; add the baking powder and salt. Mix these dry ingredients very well. b. Scoop the margarine in small bits into the bowl of flour and use finger tips to rub the margarine into the flour till the mix becomes like crumbs. c. Add cool water in bits and mix till a stiff ball of dough is formed\n.You only need a small quantity of water for this to happen. d. Cover and leave the dough to rest for 10 minutes then knead till smooth. Then: a. Set the oven to 170°C (~335°F) to preheat while you continue with the sausage roll. b. Rub margarine on the insides of the oven tray, spray flour on it, pour out the excess flour and set aside. This is so that the undersides of the sausage rolls do not stick to the pan during baking. c. Break the egg, beat it and set aside, you will need it later. Roll, Cut, Fill, Fold and Close 1. Roll out the dough to a 3mm thickness. 2. Use a blunt knife to make a rectangular cut on the rolled out dough. 3. Remove the excess dough and use a brush to rub the egg all over the rectangular dough. 4. Scoop some sausage along the edge of one length of the rectangle. The thickness of the sausage should be such that you can comfortably fold the dough and still be left with an overlap. 5. Fold the dough as you would fold a mat. 6. Rest the folded roll on the excess dough to make a seal like you would with the flap of an envelope. 7. Cut the sausage roll to desired lengths. 8. Roll out more dough, cut, fill, fold, cut into desired lengths and place in the greased oven tray till all the dough is used. 9. Rub the egg on the sausage rolls. This gives them a golden look when done. 10. Set the tray in the preheated oven and bake till they are golden brown. This should take approximately 30-40 minutes depending on the thickness of your dough and the type/heating capacity of your oven.\n"

		"title": "Suya",
		"ingredients": [
			"• Beef: Muscle with as little fat as possible",
			"• Suya Spice: This can be purchased in African food stores or from Suya Mallams in Nigeria or you can make it",
			"• Groundnut (peanut) oil (or any tasteless, odourless vegetable oil)",
			"• Salt Tool: Skewers or sticks"
		],
		"instructions": " For 190g of Suya Spice you will need the following quantities of ingredients: • 5 tablespoons crushed Kuli Kuli (110g) • 5 tablespoons ginger powder (75g) • 2 tablespoons cayenne pepper flakes (6g) • 10 strands of African Negro Pepper • 1 small stock cube (4g) • ½ teaspoon salt Notes on the ingredients 1. These ingredients are all you need to make your suya spice, no more, no less. 2. Kuli Kuli (also Kwuli Kwuli or Kwili Kwili) is groundnut (peanut) cake. To make Kuli Kuli, you simply grind roasted groundnuts, squeeze out the oil from them with a paper towel or napkin, press them into any shape you want and deep-fry them in VERY hot vegetable oil till brown and dry. Never use roasted groundnuts for your Nigerian Suya spice without first of all processing it into Kuli Kuli because there's too much oil in peanuts and this will form a paste instead of powder when you grind it. 3. Dry ground ginger is ginger that has been dried and ground into powder. You can buy it from spice shops and supermarkets anywhere in the world. The dry ginger should always be the same measurement (in tablespoons, not grams) as the Kuli Kuli. So if you want to make a large quantity of the suya spice, use the same cup/bowl/container you used to measure the crushed kuli kuli to measure the ground ginger. 4. Cayenne pepper flakes are the skin of dry cayenne pepper. Just rub dry cayenne pepper in a crucible to free them from the seeds, then separate the flakes from the seeds. The listed quantity of the flakes gives the suya spice its orange colour and the right amount of spiciness. If you add too much of these flakes or even the seeds, the suya spice will be too spicy hot and will ruin the suya you will make with the spice. 5. African Negro Pepper is very important in Suya Spice. Without it, the suya spice will not be the same. 6. Though I listed the quantities for the stock cube and salt, you should add these two to your taste. Tools you need • Crushing tools • Sieve • Plastic bowls • Spice/Coffee grinder: Before you make the Suya Spice a. Crush the Kuli Kuli with a mortar and pestle or put in a plastic bag and crush with a blunt object. Kuli Kuli usually comes in different shapes and sizes and this crushing makes it easy for you to measure it and blend it in the dry mill or coffee grinder. b. Crush the dry cayenne pepper in a mortar or any other rough container till the skin separates from the seeds. You don't need to pound it. When done, put them in a flat tray or plate, toss so that the flakes will move to one side then pick them out. Later, you can grind the seeds and use them in other Nigerian recipes. c. Break the African Negro Pepper into pieces and crush the stock cube. Directions 1. Combine all the ingredients in a bowl. 2. Grind in small batches with a dry mill till they turn into powder. Any coffee grinder will do this job very well. 3. When done, sift the suya spice with a sieve to remove all fibre from the African Negro Pepper and pieces of ingredients that did not blend well. The suya spice is ready for use in Nigerian Suya. Put the spice in plastic bags or containers and store in the freezer. It can last for years and still retain its taste and flavour. When you bring it out from the freezer, it will still be in its powdered form. Directions for making Nigerian Suya 1. Soak the Suya sticks in cold water for at least 5 hours. This ensures that the sticks do not burn/char during roasting. 2. Cut the beef into very thin short fillets. Usually, if you freeze the beef, it makes the cutting easier but Suya Mallams say that if you want to make the best suya, do not refrigerate or freeze the beef. Where I live, the butchers have an appliance for filleting meat. 3. Thread the fillets of beef on the sticks/skewers. 4. Put some groundnut/peanut/vegetable oil in a bowl, add a small quantity of salt and stir. Rub the oil on the threaded fillets of beef with a brush. This is what helps the suya spice stick to the meat so ensure that all parts of the meat is covered with oil. 5. Spread the suya spice on a flat surface and dab the threaded fillets of beef in the spice so that the spice covers all the beef. 6. Place all the spiced beef in a flat plate, cover with a thin plastic film and leave to marinate for 1 hour. Do not refrigerate. 7. Set the oven to preheat for 10 minutes. The settings should be Grill/broil (top heating) at 150°C (300°F). Suya should be roasted very slowly. You can also use a barbecue grill. 8. Lay the beef flat on the oven rack and place in the oven to roast. 9. After 15 - 20 minutes, flip the beef to roast the underside as well. The length of time you'll roast each side depends on how thick the fillets are. So total roasting time for both sides of the beef is 30 - 40 minutes. This may sound like a lot of time but it is not. The Suya is still moist when done. 10. Rub some of the remaining groundnut oil on both sides of the beef. Increase the oven temperature a bit and roast either side of the beef for 5 minutes each. Serve with chunks of onions, tomatoes, cabbage and cucumber.\n"

		],
		"instructions": "I will insist that you need a lot of oil when frying the tomatoes\n. This is so that the tomatoes will not burn till all the sour taste is gone and the water has dried from the tomatoes\n.Pour out the excess oil when the tomatoes are well fried. Just think about this as deep frying the tomatoes\n.If you don't use enough oil, the stew will have a sour taste and it will burn even if you stand there stirring frantically. Cooking should be fun, not tedious\n.If you are concerned about your health, please stay away from this stew because it is fried\n. Tinned tomato paste/puree: The tinned tomato paste sold in Nigeria is usually very thick.\nIf you try to fry this tomato paste as is, it will burn straight away. Add some water to it to bring it to a softer consistency\n.If using the watery tomato puree, cook it with the fresh tomato puree (as explained in the directions) to get it to dry up a bit and get rid of the sour taste before frying\n.The tinned tomato paste/puree is optional. Its job is to improve the redness of the tomato stew, making it look richer and more appetizing\n.If you don't want to use it, replace with fresh plum tomatoes. In Kogi state, it is common to use Tatashe (Nigerian tapered red peppers) to improve the redness of the tomato stew\n. Before you cook the stew\n. a Wash and blend the fresh plum tomatoes. Remove the seeds unless your blender can grind them very well\n.b If using the thick tinned tomato paste that is common in Nigeria, mix it with cold water to get a softer consistency\n.c If you are using the watery tinned tomato puree that is common in Europe and other parts of the world, open the tins or packets and set these aside, you'll need them soon\n.d Cut the onions into small pieces\n.Directions 1. Pour the fresh tomato blend into a pot\n.2 Cook on high heat till all the water has dried. If you have the watery tinned/boxed tomato puree, cook the blended tomato puree till almost all the water has dried then add the watery tomato puree and reduce the heat to low. Then cook till the water in the tomato puree has dried as much as possible\n.3 Add the vegetable oil, the chopped onions and the thick tomato puree you mixed in step b. Stir well\n.4 Fry on very low heat and stir at short intervals till the oil has completely separated from the tomato puree. The tomato puree will also have streaks of oil, unlike when you first added the oil and it was a smooth mix of the tomato puree and oil. Taste the fried tomato puree to make sure that the raw tomato taste is gone. With time and experience, you can tell that the tomato puree is well fried from just the look and aroma\n.5 If you are happy with the taste and you are sure that all the water has dried as much as possible, pour out the excess vegetable oil and the stew is ready to be used in Nigerian recipes\n.6 If you will not be using it immediately, leave to cool down, dish in containers and store in the freezer. To use, bring out from the freezer and allow it to defrost at room temperature and use in your Jollof Rice, Coconut Rice, Rice & Beans, Spaghetti Surprise recipes and many more. Add pepper, seasoning, chicken, beef, fish, turkey etc to get the Nigerian Beef & Chicken Stew used for eating Nigerian White Rice and other Nigerian staple food.\n"

Stir well and the sauce is ready\n.To eat, dip the pieces of roasted yam in the sauce and chew. Wash it down with a chilled drink.\n"

			"• Sweet white puna yam"
		],
		"instructions": "Directions\n.1 Peel the white yams and cut into small cubes\n.2 Rinse, put in a pot and pour enough water to cover the yam cubes. Do not add salt\n.3 Cook till the yam cubes are very soft. This is when it is easy to drive a knife into the cubes and you can see tiny white particles in the water surrounding the yams\n.4 Transfer a piece of yam to the mortar and pound with a pestle to confirm that is it well done\n.5 If well done, transfer all the yam pieces to the mortar or as much as you can pound at a time\n.6 Reserve the water used in cooking the yams because we’ll need it later\n.7 Pound the yams to crush all the pieces and form a mound of yam\n.8 With the pestle, move small amounts of the yam from one side of the mortar to another, applying pressure at the same time. This technique crushes the smaller lumps in the yam\n.9 When there are no more lumps, add some of the water used in cooking the yam. Then pound to mix the yam mound and the water. This makes the dough smooth and supple\n.10 If still hard, repeat step 9 till you get the consistency you like for your fufu meals\n.Serve with any Nigerian soup. Some people say Pounded Yam is best matched with Egusi Soup. For me, it is Pounded Yam & White Soup (Nsala Soup)\n.Tips:\n.1 If you do not have mortar and pestle, use a food processor to prepare the yam:\n.a Peel the yam and cut into big chunks\n.b Boil till soft. Do not add salt\n.c Put a few chunks in the food processor and run at the highest speed for 1 minute. Reserve the water used in cooking the yams\n.d Check the yam for lumps, if present, run the processor again till there are no lumps. If the yam dough is too hard, add some of the water used in cooking the yam; only add a small quantity at a time. Run the food processor again till the water is fully incorporated\n.e Repeat steps c and d for the rest of the yam pieces\n.2 Use the middle of the yam when preparing pounded yam because this part contains the most starch and is soft to pound. The head of the yam is usually too hard to pound and forms dark lumps in the pounded yam. The tail of the yam is too soft to form a stretchy pounded yam\n.3 This recipe is better seen than read about so if you can, watch the video on my website to get a better picture of how to prepare this.\n"

			"• Sugar",
			"• Ginger",
			"• Cinnamon"
		],

		"instructions": "1 Soak the very dry nuts in a generous quantity of cold water for 2 days.Keep it in the fridge for the duration of the soaking so that the nuts do not ferment. Most tiger nuts sold in Nigeria are fresh and well hydrated so you'll only need to soak those ones for a few hours or overnight\n.2 After the soaking, wash the nuts very well and sort out the bad ones\n.3 Put them in your kitchen blender and pour just enough water to help the blades move. We need to make this milk as concentrated and tasty as possible; you can add more water later if you wish\n.4 At this time you can add other ingredients: coconut, sugar, ginger and other flavours of your choice and blend them together. I prefer anything I eat/drink as natural as possible so I do not add any other ingredient to this drink. The natural taste of Tiger Nut Milk is so great; you do not want to alter it at all\n.5 After blending, use a chiffon cloth or ladies stocking (pantyhose) to separate the chaff from the drink. Of course, the pantyhose should be brand new, thoroughly washed with dish washing liquid\n.6 Press the stocking to make sure you squeeze out all the milk from the chaff\n.7 Put the dry chaff back in the blender, add more water and blend again. Then strain with the chiffon cloth\n.8 Repeat the process till all the milk has been extracted. I found that the milk I got the third time was too watery. So 2 times should be enough and keep an eye on the quantity of water. As a guide, I got 1.5 litres of tiger nut milk from 600g of soaked tiger nuts. Yours may vary\n.9 Pour the extracted milk into bottles and store in the fridge for up to 3 days. It should last longer in the freezer. In my home, this milk usually disappears within 2 days of making it, so I can't tell you how long it can stay in the freezer without losing its taste! Serve Tiger Nuts Milk with any snack of your choice.\n"

This can be achieved by using the flat side of the spatula to move small amounts of the fufu towards you, turn the pot and repeat\n. 6 When you have a smooth and supple mix, add some water and mix to bring it to the consistency you want. Fufu meals are slightly thicker than mashed potatoes.\n7 When happy with the consistency, add drops of water around the fufu, cover the pot and cook for about 2 minutes.
